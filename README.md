You can simply download the yadm script and put it into your $PATH. Something like this:

```sh
curl -fLo /usr/local/bin/yadm https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/raw/master/yadm && chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/yadm
```

Of course, you can change the file paths above to be appropriate for your $PATH and situation.
